# End-to-End-CI-CD-with-Terraform-Kubernetes
This project demonstrates how to provision infrastructure with Terraform, deploy applications to Kubernetes, and automate the workflow using a CI/CD pipeline. It provides an end-to-end example of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), container orchestration, and continuous delivery, making deployments more reliable, repeatable, and scalable.
